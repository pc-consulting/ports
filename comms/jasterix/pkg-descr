jASTERIX is a C++ Library for EUROCONTROL's ASTERIX to JSON
conversion. It is part of the OpenATS COMPASS project, but released
as a separate library to allow easy usage in other projects.

The library allows decoding of binary ASTERIX data into JSON. The
ASTERIX definitions are configuration only, so additional or
customized categories or editions can be added without having to
recompile. Also, using the Intel TBB library allows for reasonable
performance using multi-threading.
