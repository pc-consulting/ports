python-GPIOfbsd is a Python module that allows users
to access the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi through the
libgpio library on FreeBSD.

Unlike some other modules, python-GPIOfbsd requires
no C compilation of any kind. It doesn't use cffi,
and requires no additional downloads. This may make
it easier to get working in the first place, and
easier to maintain.
