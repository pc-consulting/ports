Please now add the Cloudlog directory to your web server so that it
is accessible through your web.

You also will have to add a database to your mysql server after the
installation. Log into your mysql server administrator account and 

  CREATE DATABASE Cloudlog;

(assuming that you wish to name your database 'Cloudlog'). Create a
new database user for Cloudlog, e. g. 'us3r', and grant it the
required access with 'password', and all db privileges:

  CREATE USER 'us3r'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Cloudlog.* TO 'us3r'@'localhost';
