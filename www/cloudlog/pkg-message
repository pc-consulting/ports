1. Cloudlog needs a mysql type database to store its data.
   I have installed a sample sequence of commands which you
   should execute in the database to prepare for cloudlog at:
      ... path to .sql sample ...
   Any further indications?

2. Cloudlog also needs a web server to operate from.
   I have installed for you a sample nginx config file at:
      /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.cloudlog-sample
   If you do not othewise have an nginx configuration made,
   you simply could replace the nginx port's default config
   with this one.
   Please also find a corresponding cloudlog nginx config file at:
      /usr/local/etc/nginx/conf.d/cloudlog.conf
   The sample nginx.conf would start nginx with that configuration.
   Cloudlog uses php-fpm for which I stored a config file at:
      /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/cloudlog.conf
   The default php-fpm configuration would use that automatically.
   Once done, you should be able to activate the updated nginx with:
      service nginx restart

3. Once database and webserver are ready, you may run the
   cloudlog install wizard via a web browser. The default
   installation described above makes cloudlog accessible at:
      https://localhost:7355/
   When you have completed the install wizard, you can start
   to locally log with cloudlog at that URL.

5. If you wish to run cloudlog on the public internet, please
   do ensure that you appropriately secure your service. A good
   idea is to connect via an independent instance, for instance
   something like a separate OPNsense-based server, e. g.:
      https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/haproxy.html
