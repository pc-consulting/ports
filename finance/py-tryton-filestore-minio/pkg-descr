The Tryton FileStore MinIO package allows Trytonâ€™s FileStore to be
configured to use S3 compatible object storage services. It can be
set up to store files in different buckets, or with different service
providers depending on the prefix used with the FileStore. This
package uses the MinIO Python SDK library to communicate with the S3
services.
