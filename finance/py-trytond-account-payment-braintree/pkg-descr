Account Payment Braintree Module

The account_payment_braintree module allows receipt of payments using Braintree.
It uses the Drop-in UI in a checkout form to handle the payment method nonce for
card and other supported payment methods.







Account

The Account stores the information about the Braintree account like the merchant
ID, the public and secret keys etc.

The account's webhook endpoint is the URL used by Braintree's webhooks. If no
webhook is setup, disputes will not update existing payments.



Customer

The Customer allows parties to be registered as Braintree customers. The
checkout/add card button opens the Braintree Drop-in UI form.

A scheduled task runs every hour to create new customers on Braintree and
another to delete them if they have become inactive.

Journal

The journal has a new field to store the Braintree account if the process method
is set to "Braintree".

Payment

The payment also has a checkout button which opens the Braintree Drop-in UI
form. A payment can be processed using a nonce or a payment method from the
customer. In case of an error, a new field displays the error message from
Braintree. The settle field can be unchecked to only authorize on processing and
settle the amount in a second step.

Two scheduled tasks run every 15 minutes to transact and settle each processing
payment. Another scheduled task also runs every 15 minutes to pull updates for
each processing payment until they have succeeded or failed.

The Braintree payments have a pull button which can be used to force an update
with the braintree transaction.



Configuration

The account_payment_braintree module uses the section account_payment_braintree
to retrieve some parameters:

payment_methods_cache: defines the duration in seconds that payment methods are
kept in the cache. The default value is 15 * 60.
