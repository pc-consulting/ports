The carrier subdivision module extends the carrier selection pattern
with the warehouse subdivision, a regular expression to match against
warehouse postal code, the customer subdivision, or a regular
expression to match against customer postal code. These criteria can
be used to restrict the usage of a carrier to a specific subdivision
or a specific postal code.
