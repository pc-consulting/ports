The stock_lot_sled module adds two fields on lot of products:
- Shelf Live Expiration Date
- Expiration Date
It also defines the default time for those fields on the product and
on the stock configuration the Shelf Live Delay.
When the shelf life of a lot expires in less than the configured
shelf life delay, it is no more used to compute the forecast quantity
of the stock.
