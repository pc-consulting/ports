The Sale Supply module adds a "supply on sale option" to purchasable products.
If selected, it will generate a purchase request for each sale line of this
product depending of the option and the stock levels. Once the purchased
products are received they are assigned on the customer shipments. If the
purchase is cancelled the sale goes back to the default supply method.
