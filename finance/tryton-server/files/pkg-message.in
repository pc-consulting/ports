If you have selected TRYTOND:

  Please check and amend your configuration according to your needs.
  You can find it at the following location.
    Tryton server configuration:  %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf
    Tryton server logging config: %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.logconf

  Prior to the first start of trytond, the Tryton daemon, please
  initialize the database with:
    trytond-admin -c <config file> -d <database name> --all
  where <config file> is the location of your trytond config file, and
  <database name> the name of your database. For instance, if you
  have not selected PSQLCLIENT nor PSQLSRV, the following command
  should work:
    trytond-admin -c %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf -d db --all -p

  You may then start the server processes via rc as follows.
    Tryton server:      service trytond onestart
    Tryton cron server: service trytond-cron onestart
    Tryton worker:      service trytond-worker onestart

  You may these services to start automatically upon boot by setting
  trytond_enable="YES", trytond-cron_enable="YES", or
  trytond-worker_enable="YES", respectively, e. g. in /etc/rc.conf.
  Please check the following startup scripts for further startup
  configuration options.
    Tryton server:      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond
    Tryton cron server: %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond-cron
    Tryton worker:      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond-worker

If you have selected WEBSRV:

  The port depends on nginx as a web proxy. Please see
    %%PREFIX%/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.d/trytond.conf[.sample]
  for an example configuration which you can include into your server
  with
    include nginx.conf.d/*.conf;
  the http {} section of your nginx configuration (usually available at
  %%PREFIX%/etc/nginx/nginx.conf).

  If you also have selected UWSGI, the port depends on uWSGI as uwsgi
  gateway. There is a configuration for uWSGI to start from in:
    %%PREFIX%/etc/trytond.uwsgi.ini.
  In order to use that, please set in /etc/rc.conf:
    uwsgi_configfile="%%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.uwsgi.ini"
  and restart the uwsgi server (e. g. with service uwsgi onerestart).

  If you use UWSGI, please also ensure that you do NOT run trytond as
  a service from rc.d (service trytond disable) as UWSGI will run it
  for you, and to stop to 'listen =' in the [web] section of your
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf.
