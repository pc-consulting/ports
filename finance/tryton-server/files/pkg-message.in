If you have selected TRYTOND:

  Please check and amend your configuration according to your needs.
  You can find it at the following location.
    Tryton server configuration:  %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf
    Tryton server logging config: %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.logconf

  Prior to the first start of trytond, the Tryton daemon, please
  initialize the database with:
    trytond-admin -c <config file> -d <database name> --all
  where <config file> is the location of your trytond config file, and
  <database name> the name of your database. For instance, if you
  have not selected PSQLCLIENT nor PSQLSRV, the following command
  should work:
    trytond-admin -c %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf -d db --all -p

  If you decided to use postgres (i. e. PSQLCLIENT or PSQLSRV),
  please ensure your postgres database is initialized and up and
  running.
  For a local postgres server (PSQLSRV), this likely would be
  achieved by something like:
    service postgresql initdb
    service postgresql onestart
  Then log into your postgres database as database admin, e. g.
    psql -U postgres
  add a trytond database user, and add a database for that user, for
  instance:
    create user trytondbuser password 'dbpassword';
    create database db with owner trytondbuser ;
  Please refer to the postgres documentation for further details
  regarding postgres.
  You then should be able to initialize the tryton database now in
  the same manner as indicated above, i. e.:
    trytond-admin -c %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf -d db --all -p
  For a non-local postgres server (i. e. just PSQLCLIENT selected),
  please configure your postgres server into your
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf and then proceed to initialize
  as just indicated.

  Please note that the port only prepares for a local sqlite database
  if you do NOT select any of PSQLCLIENT or PSQLSRV.

  You may then start the server processes via rc as follows.
    Tryton server:      service trytond onestart
    Tryton cron server: service trytond-cron onestart
    Tryton worker:      service trytond-worker onestart

  You may these services to start automatically upon boot by setting
  trytond_enable="YES", trytond-cron_enable="YES", or
  trytond-worker_enable="YES", respectively, e. g. in /etc/rc.conf.
  Please check the following startup scripts for further startup
  configuration options.
    Tryton server:      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond
    Tryton cron server: %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond-cron
    Tryton worker:      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/trytond-worker

If you have selected WEBSRV:

  The port depends on nginx as a web proxy. Please see
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.d/trytond.conf[.sample]
  for an example configuration which you can include into your server
  with
    include nginx.conf.d/*.conf;
  the http {} or https {} section of your nginx configuration
  (usually available at %%PREFIX%%/etc/nginx/nginx.conf).

  If you also have selected UWSGI, the port depends on uWSGI as uwsgi
  gateway. There is a configuration for uWSGI to start from in:
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.uwsgi.ini.
  In order to use that, please set in /etc/rc.conf:
    uwsgi_configfile="%%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.uwsgi.ini"
  and restart the uwsgi server (e. g. with service uwsgi onerestart).

  If you use UWSGI, please also ensure that you do NOT run trytond as
  a service from rc.d (service trytond disable) as UWSGI will run it
  for you, and to stop to 'listen =' in the [web] section of your
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/trytond.conf.
