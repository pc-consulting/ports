The party relationship module allows to define different types of
relations between parties.
Each relation is defined by a relation type. A reverse relation type
can be defined, so  when creating a relation of a type, the reverse
relation will be automatically created.
It is possible to order parties by how closely related they are to a
defined party. The distance is calculated based on the number of
steps it takes to get from the defined party to another. By default
all the different types of relationship are considered, but this can
be limited by adding relation_usages to the context.
