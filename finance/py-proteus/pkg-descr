Tryton Scripting Client, a library to access Tryton's models like a
client.

For instance, you could instantiate (create) a party in a script,
fill in the fields, and save the instance to the server as follows.

>>> Party = Model.get('party.party')
>>> party = Party()
>>> party.id < 0
True
>>> party.name = 'ham'
>>> party.save()
>>> party.name
'ham'
>>> party.id > 0
True

Virtually any Tryton operation can be scripted with proteus.
