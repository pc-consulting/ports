The attendance module allows you to track the entry and exit time of
employees. The module also comes with a sheet that shows for each
employee the total duration per day in the company and the detail of
the time of entrance and exit.

If the timesheet module is activated (as done in this port/package),
it also shows the time the employee has spent on timesheets for that
day.
