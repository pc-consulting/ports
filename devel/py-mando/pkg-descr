mando is a wrapper around argparse, and allows you to write complete
CLI applications in seconds while maintaining all the flexibility.

While argparse is great for simple command line applications with
only one, default command, when you have to add multiple commands and
manage them things get really messy and long. But don't worry, mando
comes to help!
