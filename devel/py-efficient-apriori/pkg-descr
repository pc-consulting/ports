An efficient pure Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm.

The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data.
The classical example is a database containing purchases from a
supermarket. Every purchase has a number of items associated with it.
We would like to uncover association rules such as {bread, eggs} ->
{bacon} from the data. This is the goal of association rule learning,
and the Apriori algorithm is arguably the most famous algorithm for
this problem.

This port provides an efficient, well-tested implementation of the
apriori algorithm as described in the original paper by Agrawal et
al, published in 1994.

The code is stable and in widespread use. It's cited in the book
"Mastering Machine Learning Algorithms" by Bonaccorso.
