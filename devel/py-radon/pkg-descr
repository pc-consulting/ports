Radon is a Python tool that computes various metrics from the source
code. Radon can compute:

- McCabe's complexity, i.e. cyclomatic complexity
- raw metrics (these include SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, etc.)
- Halstead metrics (all of them)
- Maintainability Index (the one used in Visual Studio)
